It uses [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), [front-matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/), and [liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/) to generate HTML files for your website.
